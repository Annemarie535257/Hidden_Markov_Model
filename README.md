## 🚀 How to Run the Implementation

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended) 🌟

1. **Upload your dataset to Google Drive:**
   - Create a folder called `HMM_Dataset` in your Google Drive
   - Upload the entire `dataset` folder to this location

2. **Open the notebook in Google Colab:**
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Upload `.ipynb`
   - Or open directly from Google Drive

3. **Run the notebook:**
   - Execute all cells sequentially
   - Authorize Google Drive when prompted
   - The notebook will automatically load your dataset

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn hmmlearn matplotlib seaborn
```

2. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
   - Update the dataset path if needed
   - Run all cells sequentially

### Option 3: Google Drive Integration Features

The notebook includes automatic:
- ✅ Google Drive mounting
- ✅ Dataset copying from Drive to local Colab environment
- ✅ Error handling and verification
- ✅ Clear instructions if dataset not found

## 🔧 Google Drive Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup Guide

1. **Upload Dataset to Google Drive:**
   ```
   Google Drive/
   └── HMM_Dataset/
       ├── jumping1-2025-10-23_15-07-37/
       ├── jumping2-2025-10-23_15-07-59/
       ├── running1-2025-10-23_15-06-27/
       └── [other activity folders...]
   ```

2. **Open Notebook in Google Colab:**
   - Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Upload `HMM_Implementation.ipynb`
   - Or save to Google Drive and open from there

3. **Update Dataset Path (if needed):**
   ```python
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_DATASET_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/HMM_Dataset"
   ```

4. **Run All Cells:**
   - The notebook will automatically mount Google Drive
   - Copy your dataset to the local Colab environment
   - Execute the complete HMM implementation

### Troubleshooting

- **Dataset not found?** Check the folder name is exactly `HMM_Dataset`
- **Permission errors?** Re-run the Google Drive mount cell
- **Slow performance?** Use GPU runtime in Colab (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
